# 🌟 Unsupervised News Representation Learning with Contrastive Learning 🌟

Welcome to my **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** project! This repository focuses on learning news data **unsupervisedly**, with the goal of clustering news articles in a **semantic** way. We aim to produce meaningful representations where similar news items are grouped together.

## 🔍 Project Overview

In this project, I am currently experimenting with **self-supervised contrastive learning** as the core method to tackle this challenge. By leveraging this approach, the model learns to distinguish between different news articles without labeled data, which is crucial for unsupervised learning.

## 📂 Project Structure

Here's how the project is organized:

- **`./pre_augment`**: ✨ Generate fake data points in advance to enhance contrastive learning.
- **`./main`**: 🎯 The main file to run the project, where everything comes together.
- **`./data`**: 📊 The dataset directory — real news and augmented news live here.
- **`./model`**: 🧠 Contains the model architectures for news representation learning.
- **`./train`**: 🚀 Scripts related to the training pipeline.
- **`./loss`**: ❌ Implementation of the loss functions, including contrastive loss.
- **`./utils`**: 🔧 Logging and helpful utilities for smoother development.

## 🙏 Let's pray it works!
